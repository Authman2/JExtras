# ArrayConversion
- A class with methods that are responsible for turning one dimensional arrays into two dimensional arrays. One must indicate which one dimensional array he/she wants to convert, and at which index to break it up by.

# Load
- Used for loading serialized objects. It returns the loaded object, so one must simply state which object the newly loaded object should be stored in.

# ReadFile
- Reads a file and returns the contents of that file as a string. That string can then be used and manipulated elsewhere in one's program. This class also contains methods for turning a string into an array of different types from a separator (similar to String's "split" method).
